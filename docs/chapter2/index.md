# Chapter 2: Combinational and Sequential Logic

## Introduction
Combinational and sequential logic are fundamental components of digital circuit design. Combinational logic circuits produce outputs solely based on current inputs, while sequential logic circuits incorporate memory elements, allowing them to store state information and react to both current and past inputs.

This chapter provides an in-depth understanding of:

- The principles of **combinational logic**, including basic building blocks such as **adders, multiplexers, decoders, encoders, and arithmetic logic units (ALUs)**.
- The fundamentals of **sequential logic**, covering **flip-flops, shift registers, counters, and memory elements**.
- The differences between combinational and sequential circuits and their applications in digital systems.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Design and analyze combinational and sequential logic circuits.
- Implement these circuits using logic gates and flip-flops.
- Understand how these concepts apply to practical digital system design.

This chapter serves as a foundation for more advanced topics such as **Finite State Machines (FSMs)** and **Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design**, which will be covered in later chapters.
