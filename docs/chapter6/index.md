# Chapter 6: Digital Verification & Optimization

## Introduction
Ensuring the correctness and efficiency of digital circuits is a crucial step in the design process. **Digital verification and optimization techniques** help detect errors, improve performance, and optimize power consumption. This chapter introduces industry-standard verification methodologies and best practices for designing high-quality digital systems.

This chapter provides an in-depth understanding of:
- **Simulation & Debugging Techniques**, using tools like testbenches and waveform analysis.
- **Power Optimization Strategies**, including clock gating and low-power design principles.
- **Design for Testability (DFT)**, covering scan chains and boundary scan techniques.
- **Formal Verification Methods**, such as assertion-based verification and equivalence checking.

### Topics Covered:
- **Simulation & Debugging in Digital Design**  
  - Writing Testbenches in Verilog  
  - Using Waveform Viewers and Logic Analyzers  
  - Debugging Common Issues in Digital Circuits  
- **Design for Low Power & Performance Optimization**  
  - Power Consumption Analysis in Digital Circuits
