# Chapter 3: Finite State Machines and Digital Memory

## Introduction
Finite State Machines (FSMs) and digital memory play a crucial role in designing complex digital systems. FSMs allow circuits to transition between different states based on input conditions, enabling **sequential decision-making** in hardware. Digital memory elements, such as registers and RAM, store and retrieve data efficiently.

This chapter provides an in-depth understanding of:
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**, including **Moore and Mealy models**, state diagrams, and transition tables.
- **Memory elements** such as **registers, SRAM, and DRAM**.
- The role of **counters and registers** in sequential circuit design.
- The practical applications of FSMs in **control logic, digital processing, and embedded systems**.

### Topics Covered:
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**  
  - Moore vs. Mealy FSMs  
  - State Diagrams and Transition Tables  
  - Timing Diagrams for FSMs  
- **Memory Elements and Registers**  
  - Latches and Flip-Flops in Memory Design  
  - Registers and Shift Registers  
  - Counters (Synchronous vs. Asynchronous)  
- **Types of Digital Memory**  
  - Static RAM (SRAM) vs. Dynamic RAM (DRAM)  
  - Non-Volatile Memory (Flash, EEPROM)  
- **Applications of FSMs and Memory**  
  - Control Logic in Digital Systems  
  - Data Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms  
  - FSM-Based Circuit Design for Embedded Applications  

### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this chapter, you will:
- **Differentiate** between Moore and Mealy FSM models.
- **Design** FSMs using state diagrams, transition tables, and timing analysis.
- **Understand** the structure and function of registers, shift registers, and counters.
- **Analyze** the differences between SRAM, DRAM, and non-volatile memory.
- **Apply** FSM and memory concepts to real-world digital design challenges.

This chapter sets the stage for **Verilog and Digital Circuit Design**, which will be explored in the next chapter.
