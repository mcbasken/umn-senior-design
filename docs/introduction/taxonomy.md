## 1. Foundations of Digital Design
Digital design forms the basis of modern computing, allowing for the creation of efficient hardware systems. This section introduces fundamental concepts necessary for digital circuit design.

### Topics Covered:
- **Number Systems and Representations**: Binary, octal, hexadecimal, and decimal systems.
- **Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates**: Fundamental logic operations and De Morgan’s Theorems.
- **Truth Tables and Logic Expressions**: Representation and simplification techniques.
- **Karnaugh Maps and Simplification Techniques**: Methods for optimizing logic expressions.

## 2. Combinational and Sequential Logic
Combinational circuits determine output based only on current inputs, while sequential circuits introduce memory elements that consider past inputs.

### Topics Covered:
- **Combinational Circuits**: Adders, multiplexers, decoders, encoders, and ALUs.
- **Sequential Circuits**: Flip-flops (D, T, JK, SR), shift registers, and counters.

## 3. Finite State Machines and Digital Memory
State-based circuits and memory elements play a crucial role in digital design, allowing devices to maintain and transition between states.

### Topics Covered:
- **Finite State Machines (FSMs)**: Moore vs. Mealy models, state diagrams.
- **Memory Elements and Storage**: SRAM vs. DRAM, memory hierarchy.

## 4. Verilog and Digital Circuit Design
Verilog is the primary hardware description language (HDL) used in digital design. This section covers Verilog basics and digital circuit design techniques.

### Topics Covered:
- **Verilog Syntax and Semantics**: Data types, operators, and module definitions.
- **Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design**: Structural and behavioral modeling.
- **Clocking and Timing Analysis**: Flip-flop behavior, edge-triggering, and timing constraints.

## 5. FPGA and Embedded Systems
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a flexible platform for hardware acceleration and embedded systems.

### Topics Covered:
- **FPGA Architecture**: Configurable logic blocks, interconnects, and bitstream generation.
- **FPGA vs. ASIC Design**: Differences, advantages, and trade-offs.
- **Embedded Systems and Hardware Acceleration**: Interfacing with peripherals, FPGA programming.

## 6. Digital Verification and Optimization
Verification ensures that digital circuits function correctly under all conditions, while optimization techniques enhance performance and efficiency.

### Topics Covered:
- **Simulation and Debugging**: Verilog testbenches and waveform analysis.
- **Power Optimization in Digital Circuits**: Low-power design strategies.
- **Design for Testability (DFT) and Built-in Self-Test (BIST)**: Techniques to ensure manufacturability.
- **Formal Verification and Assertion-Based Verification**: Methods for verifying correctness.
