# Chapter 4: Verilog and Digital Circuit Design

## <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
Verilog is a **hardware description language (HDL)** used for designing and modeling digital circuits. It allows engineers to describe digital systems at multiple levels of abstraction, from behavioral to gate-level representations.

This chapter introduces:
- The syntax and semantics of **Verilog**.
- The **Register Transfer Level (RTL) Design** approach.
- The importance of **testbenches** and simulation.
- **Clocking strategies** and static timing analysis.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
- Write and understand **Verilog modules** and their components.
- Implement **combinational and sequential logic** using Verilog.
- Perform **simulation and debugging** of digital circuits.
- Optimize digital designs using **timing analysis**.
