# Chapter 5: FPGA and Embedded Systems

## <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) and embedded systems are critical components in modern digital design. FPGAs provide flexibility and reconfigurability, making them ideal for prototyping and high-performance applications, while embedded systems integrate software and hardware to create efficient computing solutions.

This chapter explores:
- The **architecture and functionality of FPGAs**.
- The differences between **FPGAs and ASICs**.
- The **design flow for FPGA development**, including synthesis, placement, and routing.
- **Embedded processors** and their applications in digital systems.

By the end of this chapter, you will:
- Understand the **fundamental architecture of FPGAs**.
- Compare the **trade-offs between FPGA and ASIC designs**.
- Develop a **basic FPGA project** using Verilog.
- Implement **embedded processing solutions** in digital circuits.

This chapter builds the foundation for **digital verification, debugging, and optimization**, covered in Chapter 6.
