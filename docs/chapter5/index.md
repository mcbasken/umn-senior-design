# Chapter 5: FPGA Design & Applications

## Introduction
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (**FPGAs**) are powerful reconfigurable digital devices used in a wide range of applications, from embedded systems to AI accelerators. Understanding FPGA design flow, architecture, and constraints is crucial for implementing high-performance digital circuits.

This chapter provides an in-depth understanding of:
- **FPGA vs. ASIC Design**, exploring trade-offs in cost, performance, and flexibility.
- **FPGA Design Flow**, from synthesis to bitstream generation.
- **Embedded Systems in FPGA**, integrating processors and peripherals.
- **Timing Constraints and Power Optimization**, ensuring efficient and reliable FPGA implementation.

### Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to FPGA Architecture**  
  - FPGA Fabric and Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs)  
  - Look-Up Tables (LUTs) and Routing Resources  
  - FPGA vs. ASIC: Pros and Cons  
- **FPGA Design Flow**  
  - High-Level Synthesis (HLS) vs. RTL Design  
  - Synthesis, Place & Route, and Bitstream Generation  
  - FPGA Programming and Configuration
