# Glossary of Terms

#### Adder

A digital circuit that performs addition of numbers, typically binary.

#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

A combinational circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations on binary inputs.

#### Boolean Algebra

A branch of mathematics dealing with variables that have two distinct values (true/false or 1/0).

#### Clock Signal

A periodic signal used to synchronize the operations of digital circuits.

#### Combinational Logic

Logic circuits whose output depends only on the current inputs, not on previous input history.

#### D Flip-Flop

A memory element that captures the value of the D-input at a particular edge of the clock signal.

#### Decoder

A circuit that converts coded inputs into coded outputs where the output lines are mutually exclusive.

#### Encoder

A circuit that converts active input signals into a coded output.

#### Finite State Machine (FSM)

A computational model consisting of a finite number of states and transitions based on inputs.

#### Full Adder

A digital circuit that adds three binary bits, producing a sum and a carry output.

#### Hazard

A temporary fluctuation in output when inputs change in a digital logic circuit, often due to delays.

#### Latch

A basic memory device that can store one bit of information and maintains its output until changed.

#### Logic Gate

A fundamental building block of digital circuits that performs a basic logical function like AND, OR, or NOT.

#### Minterm

A product (AND combination) of all the variables in a Boolean function, either in true or complemented form, representing a single row in the truth table where the output is 1.

#### Multiplexer (MUX)

A combinational circuit that selects one of many inputs and forwards it to a single output line.

#### Register

A group of flip-flops used to store multiple bits of data.

#### Setup Time

The minimum time before the clock edge that the input signal must be held stable to ensure proper operation of a flip-flop.

#### Synchronous Circuit

A digital circuit where changes in the state are triggered by a clock signal.

#### Timing Diagram

A graphical representation of the relationships between signals and time in a digital circuit.

#### Verilog

A hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems.
